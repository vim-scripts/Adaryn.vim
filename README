Adaryn - A color scheme named after my daughter, Adaryn. (A-da-rin)
I like deep, sharp colors and this scheme is inspired by Bohdan Vlasyuk\\&#039s darkblue.

The cterm background is Black since the DarkBlue was just too light.
Also the cterm colors are very close to a dark  Borland C++ color setup.
